dnl the specified PREFIX and set with_expat to PREFIX, or 'yes' if PREFIX
dnl has not been specified. Also HAVE_LIBEXPAT, HAVE_EXPAT_H are defined.
dnl If --with-expat has not been specified, set with_expat to 'no'.

dnl This is necessary to adapt a whole lot of packages that have expat
dnl bundled as a static library.
