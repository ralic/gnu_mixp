* copyright update policy
*** individual files only on change
*** individual years

* repo branch discipline
*** no ‘master’ -- do not panic!
*** archive
    This branch is for what was already released.  It will never be rebased.
    Its tip will always have a commit title starting with "Release".
*** p -- "perhaps", "probably"
    This branch is where largely-stable changes intended for the next release
    live.  It's very unlikely to undergo rebase, but not entirely impossible.
    (Since Mixp not so popular, we don't bother announcing it.)
*** q-TOPIC -- "questionably", "querulously"
    These are experimental, exploring the particular TOPIC.  They are intended
    to be ephemeral, undergoing rebase, amendment, and ultimately removal.
